Simple MATLAB demo on how to use CRLB for optimal experimental design of diffusion MRI.

This demo complements the talk "Acquisition Approaches: From basic to Advanced", given at the [ISMRM 2022 Workshop on Diffusion MRI: From Research to Clinic in Amsterdam, The Netherlands](https://www.ismrm.org/workshops/2022/Diffusion/#inline-program).
